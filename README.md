## How it works

`storybook-chrome-screenshot` executes [Storybook][storybook] in a child process and accesses the launched page using [Puppeteer][puppeteer]. It is a very simple mechanism.  
For that reason, you can easily shoot screenshots by simply creating a story that works with the browser.




## Getting Started

It is very easy to introduce `storybook-chrome-screenshot` in your project.



### Installation

First install `storybook-chrome-screenshot`.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev storybook-chrome-screenshot
```

> **Note:** Please do not use globally but let it operate locally.



### Register Addon

Next, register Addon.

**.storybook/addons.js**

```javascript
// Other addons...
import 'storybook-chrome-screenshot/register';
```



### Setup your stories

Create a story with [withScreenshot](#withscreenshotoptions--).

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';
import { withScreenshot } from 'storybook-chrome-screenshot';
import Button from './Button';

storiesOf('Button', module)
  .add('with text',
    withScreenshot()(() => (
      <Button>Text</Button>
    ))
  );
```



### Run `storybook-chrome-screenshot` Command

Open `package.json` and add a `screenshot` script for run `storybook-chrome-screenshot` command.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "screenshot": "storybook-chrome-screenshot -p 9001 -c .storybook"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Parameters such as ports and configuration files should match the parameters of the `Storybook` you are currently using.

After that, just run the `npm run screenshot` command, shotting a component wrapped with [withScreenshot](#withscreenshotoptions--) and save the images.

```bash
$ npm run screenshot
```



### Support for addDecorator

Or by using `addDecorator ()`, it is possible to shotting all the decorated stories.

```javascript
import { withScreenshot } from 'storybook-chrome-screenshot';

storiesOf('Button', module)
  .addDecorator(withScreenshot({
    /* ...options */
  }))
  .add('with primary', () => (
    <Button primary>Primary Button</Button>
  ))
  .add('with secondary', () => (
    <Button secondary>Secondary Button</Button>
  ));
```




## API

### withScreenshot(options = {})

Notify [Puppeteer][puppeteer] of the story wrapped in this function and let it recognize it as the target of the screenshot.

The following objects of `options` can be specified.

```javascript
{
  delay: 0,               // Delay milliseconds when shooting screenshots
  viewport: {             // Browser's viewport when shooting screenshots. (See: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pagesetviewportviewport)
    width: 1024,
    height: 768,
    deviceScaleFactor: 1,
    isMobile: false,
    hasTouch: false,
    isLandscape: false,
  },
}
```


### setScreenshotOptions(options = {})

Sets the default value of the option used with `withScreenshot()`.  
It is useful for changing Viewport of all stories.

**Example: .storybook/config.js**

```javascript
import { setScreenshotOptions } from 'storybook-chrome-screenshot';

setScreenshotOptions({
  viewport: {
    width: 768,
    height: 400,
    deviceScaleFactor: 2,
  },
});
```


### getScreenshotOptions()

Get the current option used with `withScreenshot()`.

```javascript
import { getScreenshotOptions } from 'storybook-chrome-screenshot';

console.log(getScreenshotOptions);
// => Current options...
```
